# Chess-AI

## Plan of action:    
For this project I am going to use Jupiter notebook, this document will consists of multiple chess AI
versions. The best version will be used in the final delivery of the project.

## Project Goal:     
When playing the game against a human, the chess AI needs to predict the best possible move in every
round, until the game is completed. This can be done by calculating the best score values or I can try
something with Neural networks and see what results it delivers.
